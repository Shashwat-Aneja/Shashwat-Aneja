# Hi, I'm Shashwat Aneja

I am a student developer focused on artificial intelligence, VR/game development, and sensor-driven systems. I build practical projects that combine software engineering, hardware integration, and modern machine learning techniques. My work reflects a strong interest in applied AI and real-world problem solving.

## What I Work On
- VR cricket simulations using Unity and Godot  
- Arduino + MPU6050 motion-tracking systems  
- Machine learning experiments in Python  
- Web development and automation tools  
- Class XII academic projects involving mathematics and computing  

## Technical Skills
**Languages:** Python, C#, C++, JavaScript  
**Frameworks & Engines:** Unity, Godot, PyTorch, scikit-learn  
**Hardware:** Arduino Nano, MPU6050, sensor-based motion systems  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux, VS Code  

## Projects
- **VR Cricket Game:** Full simulation with head tracking, gaze interaction, and AI fielding.  
- **Arduino Motion Tracking:** Real-time bat orientation using MPU6050 and custom calibration.  
- **ML Experiments:** Image classification, data modeling, and small neural networks.  
- **Web Tools:** Small utilities and interactive sites for learning and automation.

## Goals
I aim to deepen my expertise in AI, build more advanced simulations, and contribute to research-focused projects. I am particularly interested in combining machine learning with interactive environments and physical hardware.
